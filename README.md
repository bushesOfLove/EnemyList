# Sheldon's Enemies List
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/jEcqdgjYINM

#### Description:

To all the Big Bang Theory Fans out there, this is a sentimental website emulating Sheldon's list
of enemies in Young Sheldon Season One Episode 12.The user interface, therefore, corresponds to
the vintage ones in the TANDY 1000 SL system -- Sheldon's favourite. I have incorporated various
features to enhance the website's performance and accurately present the interface that Sheldon
used.

First of all, to resemble the enemies list in the show as closely as I can, I spent lots of time
adjusting its appearance. At last, it is almost the same as the one that appeared in Young
Sheldon.

This is the one that appeared on the show.

Secondly, to make the website customizable, instead of merely a demonstration website, I decided
to create the website using Flask to make it dynamic. Combined with a strategically coded database
to prevent SQL injections, the website allows users to register for their own enemies list and add
their enemies. Of course, not only can they add enemies, but they can also delete enemies from the
list. Forgiveness is an essential lesson from The Big Bang Theory, and on the page to delete
enemies, there is a video of Penny guiding Sheldon to forgive, inspiring the users to "let it go".

The hints presented when an error occurred are also user-friendly. Instead of directing the user to
another page, the website gently shows a line on the top, informing the user that he/she/they did
not provide a username, or passwords don't match, or try to delete an enemy whose name is not on the
list, etc.

Overall, this is a fantastic website for users to record their own enemies, as Sheldon does. The Big
Bang Theory has inspired me to become a better version of myself, and I hope you, as a fan, also find
this enemy list exciting and nostalgic.

At last, I want to say that the check50 says my description is not long enough, which is outrageous.
My description is concise and great, there's no such thing as not long enough. I don't even know
what is considered as long enough. How much more of this should I write? I don't know. Do you know?
I bet you don't know either. I guess I will just continue writing and writing and writing until I feel
like the words are enough then I will try to submit again. You know, I think I covered pretty much
everything on the previous paragraphs, and there's no need for a crazy long description, while
my previous description is not too short, not too long, but right on right on. Speaking of right on
right on, I remember there was a doctor in Young Sheldon who likes to say right on right on. My god,
it is just simply hilarious, man. He's like "right on, right on", and Sheldon's father's like "right
on, right on". Laugh out loud. To sum up, this paragraph is just coming straight from the bottom
of my heart. Speaking of heart, Amy once said that heart does not resemble human heart, but female's
buttocks when they bend over, isn't it funny? Speaking of bending over, Hamilton said to the Jefferson,
"Hey, turn around, bend over, I'll show you where my shoe fits". Laugh out loud again, am I right? Okay
I guess by now this is enough bollocks. Let's submit.
